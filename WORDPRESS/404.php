        <p>I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me the perfect designer for a person like you. Maybe you should check out my <a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>">latest work</a> or head on back <a href="<?php bloginfo('url');?>/">home</a> to see why?</p>
